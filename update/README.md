# mkrs-ranker
Dynamic rank generator for the MKRS NFT collection on Solana

This was originally used for identifying rare MKRS to bid on before the official rarity was released. Now it is more to produce spreadsheets of collection attributes and trait statistics.

The Hash List at [./data/hash-list.json](./data/hash-list.json) was generated by [MagicEden](https://magiceden.io/mintlist-tool) using creator address `39c2zbDBpJoNhrM6iFtoiQ2JxLntG7L3UohXeBCBRwiH`.

A `.data/config.json` file must created with the following structure. The `mine` is an array of your wallet addresses for tracking purposes. `watch` is used to produce a spreadsheet of just those NFTs that meet additional criteria to be watched. `rare` will filter the NFTs to JSON for use in other programs or reporting.

```
{
    "mine": [
        "<your wallet address 1>",
        "<your wallet address 2>",
        "..."
    ],
    "watch": {
        "floor": 5,
        "oneof": 10,
        "owned": 25,
        "rank": 600
    },
    "rare": {
        "oneof": 10,
        "rank": 30
    }
}
```
